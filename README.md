# CLI-TSCONFIG

I created this basic CLI for myself to make things easier when I begin a new project and want to use TypeScript. I'll add more config file options for other frameworks.

> **Note:** You should install this as a dev dependency

### Installation

<a name="installation"></a>

```shell
npm install cli-tsconfig
```

### Usage
